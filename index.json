Recently, I started setting up a home lab server using one of my old laptops. Initially, I relied on qBittorrent and Aria2 with AriaNG to download files for my personal Jellyfin Service. However, finding the right content via torrents was often challenging.Telegram, on the other hand, makes it incredibly easy to discover and share files. But downloading those files directly to a server isn’t straightforward — at least, not out of the box. I wanted a way to send videos or movies directly from my phone into my home lab server over Telegram, without needing to log in via SSH or set up web UIs for upload. My first instinct was to use a Telegram bot, but I quickly hit a few roadblocks: Telegram bots running on a public server have a 50MB file size limit when using the getFile method, making them unsuitable for downloading large video files. Most Telegram bot libraries designed for local server setups are typically written in Python, which isn’t my strongest area — so I began looking for a Node.js alternative. Bots usually require public endpoints or tunneling to work properly with webhooks, adding complexity to a local setup. That’s when I discovered GramJS, a Telegram MTProto client for Node.js. It allowed me to use my preferred tech stack to build a flexible and fully offline-compatible solution.

The files are routed based on keywords (e.g., #movie, #series) and ingested by Jellyfin. I also get real-time progress updates and control the system via chat commands.

Object.freeze() to Lock Configs🧠 What it does: Prevents changes to an object.A frozen object can no longer be changed: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability, configurability, writability, or value cannot be changed, and the object’s prototype cannot be re-assigned. js const CONFIG = Object.freeze({ mode: \"production\" }); CONFIG.mode = \"debug\"; // ❌ No effect console.log(CONFIG.mode); // 'production' In the above example, the mode property of CONFIG object does not get changed as the CONFIG is freezed.

This actually saves us from writing wrapper classes and assigning the fields from the same in apex in case we need to update the same object.🪄 If you have not used it yet, here is an example🔬: 👉Lets say, you need to update some fields on an Account from a LWC component based on user action. Of course 𝘶𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥 from '𝘭𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨/𝘶𝘪𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘈𝘱𝘪' should be the first option we should be considering✅. But what if user normally should not have FLS to the field 🤔💭. Or the org is poorly setup and you dont have the time or authority to fix things. This is where we can utilize the approach which i was mentioning above.📈 👉You can create a js object with field to edit from LWC and pass it to an Apex method without using any wrapper.🚀 JS 𝘭𝘦𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥 = { 𝘴𝘰𝘣𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘛𝘺𝘱𝘦: \"𝘈𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵\", 𝘐𝘥: 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴.𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘐𝘥, 𝘍𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦__𝘤: \"𝘕𝘦𝘸 𝘝𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦\" };\r👉And then you can pass the object to an apex method from LWC component 🚀 JS 𝘶𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘈𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘍𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥𝘴({𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦:𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥}) .𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘯((𝘳𝘦𝘴) =\u003e 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘦.𝘭𝘰𝘨(\"𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥 𝘶𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥\")) .𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩((𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘳) =\u003e 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘦.𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘳(\"𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘳: \" + 𝘑𝘚𝘖𝘕.𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘪𝘧𝘺(𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘳)));\r👉Now the Apex method can written as below🚀: apex 𝘱𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘪𝘤 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘴𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴 𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘴𝘖𝘣𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘍𝘳𝘰𝘮𝘓𝘞𝘊 {\r@𝘈𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘌𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘥(𝘤𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦=𝘧𝘢𝘭𝘴𝘦)\r𝘱𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘪𝘤 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘤 𝘉𝘰𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘯 𝘶𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘈𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘍𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥𝘴(𝘈𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦){\r𝘈𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘤𝘤=𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘈𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵(𝘐𝘥=𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦.𝘐𝘥);\r𝘪𝘧(𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨.𝘐𝘴𝘕𝘰𝘵𝘉𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘬(𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦?.𝘍𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦__𝘤))\r{\r𝘢𝘤𝘤.𝘍𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦__𝘤=𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦.𝘍𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥𝘛𝘰𝘜𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦__𝘤;\r}\r𝘶𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘢𝘤𝘤;\r𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯 𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘦; }\r}\rNote that i have created new Account variable acc, reassigned the field we are expecting to this new variable from accountToUpdate variable and updated acc instead of directly updating accountToUpdate🚫. This is because the object accountToUpdate is created from front end JS and can be manipulated to update unintended fields by adding extra fields from front end. So as a better security practice👮, i believe its better to add this check from Apex side🕵️‍♀️.

Salesforce’s Experienced Page Time (EPT) helps measure exactly that! 🌟 EPT is measured as the time from the page start to when no more activity occurs for at least two frames (~33 ms). The two extra frames help to avoid false positives due to asynchronous calls. These calls include any XMLHttpRequests (XHRs) activity, any storage activity, or any user interaction or client-side work of any kind in the main JavaScript thread. Read here 📊 Why is EPT important?

But there’s one method in the HTTP family that often goes unnoticed: the HEAD method. 🕵️‍♂️What is the HEAD method? Think of it as GET’s efficient sibling. When you make a HEAD request, you’re essentially asking for the headers only, without the response body. This makes it perfect for: 👉 Checking resource availability: Quick and light! Want to see if a resource is there without fetching the whole payload? HEAD has your back. 👉 Optimizing performance: By skipping the body, you reduce data usage and improve speed, especially handy for resource-heavy content. 👉Update cached resources: To Check if a resource has been modified, if not reuse the local copy otherwise GET the resource again. 👉 Testing and debugging: Need to confirm headers (like Content-Type, Content-Length, or cache headers) before committing to a full request? HEAD can verify those without the wait. Why isn’t it used more often? Since HEAD doesn’t pull in the actual content, it’s commonly skipped in favor of GET. But in scenarios where data isn’t necessary or a quick availability check is all you need, HEAD is the right thing to use! It may be not used as others in the room, but HEAD can improve your API efficiency and reduce unnecessary data transfer. Have you used the HEAD method in your work?
