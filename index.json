Done!🪄🪄🪄 Here is a quick demo on the same watch demo video on linkedin SF documentation on data export tree says, The SOQL query can return a maximum of 2,000 records. But I was able to retrieve 10000 records from an org and was able to get even more records(20000) by setting “maxQueryLimit” in sfdx config file. Still i think it would be safe if we stick to 2000 count 🟥 Remember! You should have sf cli installed! The objects and fields is expected in target org as source org Include all required fields in the query while running export command or you will get Required field missing error while importing data in target org There is a very interesting flag --plan which we will discuss in another post❗ Do Check Salesforce Documentation on data export tree and data import tree This Content was originally posted in linkedin View Post ","date":"2024-05-24","objectID":"/posts/transfer-records-using-cli/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["LWR Site","LWC","Custom Labels","Admin"],"title":"Transfer Records Using SF CLI Command❗❗❗","uri":"/posts/transfer-records-using-cli/#what-is-the-easiest-way-to-transfer-few-records-and-child-records-between-two-sandboxesorgs"},{"categories":["IT","Salesforce"],"content":"About using Custom Label as a Property in Lightning Page \u0026 LWR Site","date":"2024-05-23","objectID":"/posts/custom-label-as-property/","series":null,"tags":["LWR Site","LWC","Custom Labels","Admin"],"title":"Custom Label As A Property In Lightning Page \u0026 LWR Site🔖🔖🔖","uri":"/posts/custom-label-as-property/"},{"categories":["IT","Salesforce"],"content":" ","date":"2024-05-23","objectID":"/posts/custom-label-as-property/:0:0","series":null,"tags":["LWR Site","LWC","Custom Labels","Admin"],"title":"Custom Label As A Property In Lightning Page \u0026 LWR Site🔖🔖🔖","uri":"/posts/custom-label-as-property/#"},{"categories":["IT","Salesforce"],"content":"\rDid you know that we can use Custom labels as Property input values in Lightning App BuilderUsing this format {!$𝘓𝘢𝘣𝘦𝘭.𝘊𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘮𝘓𝘢𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘕𝘢𝘮𝘦}.
