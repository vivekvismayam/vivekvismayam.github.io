# Salesforce Rest ExplorerüöÄ VS Code Extension for Salesforce Developers

&nbsp;  

## üöÄVS Code Extension for Salesforce Developers! üöÄ

**Salesforce Rest Explorer** is a VS Code extension that enables Salesforce developers to hit REST APIs directly from VS Code! It uses the endpoint and authentication of the default org set in the SFDX project, making API calls smoother.

This project has been a great learning experience, and I‚Äôm proud that every day, I‚Äôm defenitely getting better at reading documentation, troubleshooting, and implementing new ideas‚Äîall thanks to the vast resources and support available online. 


## Requirements for the Extension to run:
- üìå VS Code Version 1.80.0 and Above
- üìå SF CLI Installed 
- üìå Extension from a sfdx project(Where a default org is set).

üèÅAfter installing the extension from Marketplace, execte command (ctrl+shift+p) 'Open Salesforce Rest Explorer' to open the Salesforce Rest Explorer UI!üèÅ

> ‚ö†The default org will be selected as target org by the extension. If you change the default org , do remember to click on 'Set Default Org' button to update the target org in the extension !!

‚ö† In case you are still using old SF CLI version where you use 'sfdx' in commands instead of sf, you can configure the same from vs code settings - 'CLI Command'. I will pusblish a demo on the same if neeed!

Based on the feedbacks I received  , following few features were released which is available after New version 1.0.1 üéØüì¢

Here are the major changes ü™õüîßüî©!

1. **Enabled Search** üîç: You can now search for specific texts in 'Salesforce Rest Explorer' window using ctrl+F. This will all the matching results on the window. This is helpful if you are looking for some specific details in response body or headers!

2. **Introduced 'Format Response Body To Hyperlink Salesforce Endpoints' toggle button üïπ**: The hyperlinks were getting formatted through JS code which was taking some time if the response body is too big/contain too many Salesforce endpoint Urls. Turning off this button displays the responses faster!
